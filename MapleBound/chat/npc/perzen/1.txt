Oh dear... I'm sure you've heard about the trouble Ellin Forest is under from the other individuals
in the town. I suspect that some monsters in the forest have grown from a mysterious hormone that
accelerates their maturity to sizes that are normally unimaginable. To eliminate this problem, we need
someone to kill a herd of them so that the population will dwindle. Can you take on that challenge? I think
40 Mossy Mushrooms, 40 Primitive Boars, and 40 Stone Bugs will suffice.
