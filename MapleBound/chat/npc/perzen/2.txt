Wow! You've actually killed them all! For a second there, I didn't think you would be able to handle
such a task. You've certainly pulled through, and gained even more experience than you had before.
Thank you again for your kind efforts. I have hopes that Ellin will be peaceful in the near
future. I heard that a portal has opened somewhere within the forest to some otherworldly area. Does it have
something to do with you?
