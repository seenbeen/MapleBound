You're finally awake! We wern't sure what to do with you there... The word is that Arkarium
sealed you up and sent you back here with a little twist on the side. I've come to believe that the world
is now distorted for you. What I mean is that there may be portals that are out of the ordinary.
They appear in the most random areas around the world and they'll take you to the most random places.
Legend has it that these portals appear whenever a hero helps out someone in need. I suggest you do the same if the portals are not appearing for you. These portals may be intimidating, but rest assured, I am confident that they'll bring you to your destination.
