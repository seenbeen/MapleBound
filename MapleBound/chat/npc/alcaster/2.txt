Since you just woke up, I think I'll refresh your memory of how this environment works. Use the RIGHT and LEFT arrows
to move around. ALT is to jump and UP is to climb ladders and ropes while you're in the air. DOWN is to crouch. Hold down SHIFT to
utilize your bow and fire arrows (the longer it'd held down, the more powerful the shot). Don't forget about W and S - they control
the angle of your shot.
