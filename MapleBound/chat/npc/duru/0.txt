Ugh... I've been injured in the worse place ever. Last night I went out into the forest
and got trampled by the huge monsters in the wilderness...
There was this huge stone bug that was disguised as a patch of moss! He knocked me over and gave me a mild concussion and I passed out for a couple of moments before some of the townspeople found me.
