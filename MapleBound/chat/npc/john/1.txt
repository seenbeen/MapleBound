Monsters have been crowding the harbor lately and it's been hard to enjoy my time here. Would you mind
eliminating some of them? I think if you get rid of 10 Blue Snails, 10 Pigs, and 10 Ribbon Pigs, I'd have a
much more enjoyable experience here at Lith Harbor watching those ships sail into the vast oceanic void.
