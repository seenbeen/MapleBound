The Queen is set to come around this area of the Nihal Desert from her home to tour out west. We're scrambling to
corner off the district so we can prepare for this once in a lifetime event! Unfortunately, some monsters out in the
desert are preventing us from tackling the problem with full force. Can you help us? Kill 60 Meerkats, 60 Kiyos, and
60 Desert Giants... Yes, I am positive that'll be enough to clear the way for now.
