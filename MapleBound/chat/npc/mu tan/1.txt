I take it that you've seen the horrendous invaders that are taking over Herb Town? They're ruining our business
and killing all of our good crops! We can't go on living with them or else we'll go broke. Say... what if you taught
them a lesson? Kill 50 Bellflower Roots, 50 Sr. Bellflower Roots, and 50 Alligators so that the rest of them get
the message!
